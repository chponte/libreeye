Libreeye: open source surveillance
=========================================

Libreeye is an open source surveillance system, written in Python, offering:

A reliable recording system 
   Libreeye's recording engine uses ffmpeg underneath, which ensures
   compatibility with most cameras and protocols.

Network-based redundancy
   Libreeye can stream live video feed to YouTube Live, ensuring that your
   recordings are kept safe in the event of an intrusion.

Motion detection
   Video reviewing is unmanageable when your system uses multiple cameras.
   Motion detection significantly reduces the time spent reviewing the
   recordings.
